# 3dpaint
Windows freeware app for 3D painting / texturing of models

Major update (0.20) features a more physically based workflow with normal mapping, specular and metallic channels. However it does require OpenGL 3.0. If your PC does not support this, version 0.19 may still work and allow diffuse painting.
